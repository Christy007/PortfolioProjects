Exploring the dataset and creating a new table required for the visualization in Tableau.

Link to Dataset: **https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths**

SQL File name: **[Covid19_PortfolioProject.sql](https://github.com/ChristyTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data_Exploration_Using_SQL/Covid19_PortfolioProject.sql)**

# Tasks Involved
- Finding likelihood of covid-death in each country on a particular date (Total cases vs Total deaths)
- Displaying percentge of population infected with COVID (Total cases vs Population)
- Finding the country with Highest infection rate compared to population
- Sorting countries with highest death count AFTER removing the continent data
- Displaying Total population vs Vaccinations
- Displaying rolling count of people vaccinated
- Using CTE (Common Table Expression) to find Percentage of PeopleVaccinated vs population
- Creating **Temp table** to find Percentage of PeopleVaccinated vs population
- Creating VIEW to store data for later visualizations

# Challenges
- Combining covid-death and covid-vaccination dataset together to display **Rolling count** of people vaccinated
- Creating **VIEW** to save the required data for later visualizations
